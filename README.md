# snaverse - your step by step guide to the SNA universe :)

The `snaverse` is a suite of packages to learn and perform social network analysis (sna). 

The suite is composed of three packages
- `sna4tutti`: containing tutorials to learn sna
- `snafun`: containing functions to perform sna in an easy way
- `SNA4DSData`: containing Dataset for learning purposes

The `snaverse` is a companion for the mandatory first-year course Social Network Analysis for Data Science (SNA4DS) taught at JADS (Tilburg University + Eindhoven Technical University) within the master in Data Science, Business, and Entrepreneurship.

In order to use the `snaverse`, follow these few steps: 

1) install the package remotes: `install.packages("remotes")`

2) install the package remotes: `install.packages("rstudio.prefs")`

3) install the snaverse: `remotes::install_github("SNAnalyst/snaverse", dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE)`


Now you have three functions to join the snaverse :)

4) run `snaverse::rstudiofy(setup = "SNA4DS")` to set up the Rstudio IDE in the optimized way for the SNA4DS class

5) run `snaverse::packagefy(install = "all")` to install all the packages needed to make the snaverse work.

6) run `snaverse::snaversify(install = "snaverse")` to install all the packages in the snaverse suite

After that, you are ready to go! 

Enjoy the `snaverse`!
